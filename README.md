Turning An Excel File Into A Web App With Python (Streamlit)

In this project, Python Library Streamlit is used to convert Excel Files into a Web Application. 

The beauty of Streamlit is that you can create web applications directly in Python, without needing to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 

The Web App is fully interactive and will be updated, whenever you make changes in the Excel file.
